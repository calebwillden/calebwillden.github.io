# Mistborn: Doing Good is How You Worship

In Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn: Alloy of Law, the protagonist worships a god known as Harmony. One of Harmony's tenets is:

> Don't waste time worshiping me. Doing good is how you worship.

That might be paraphrased, but it reminds me of the scripture in the Bible where Jesus says in Matthew 25:40:

> Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

This is closely related to the Matthew 7:12:

> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should cdo to you, do ye even so to them

Which is basically the golden rule:

> Treat others as you want to be treated.

# 'Good' and 'Bad'

I've talked about this before.

These two words are incredibly unhelpful, when used imprecisely, which I've found to be most of the time.

They are often shortcuts, abstractions to categorize things. Shortcuts are essential to brain function, but they can also lead to cognitive difficulties and interpersonal conflict.

> He's a bad person

> Donuts are not good for you

> I'm bad at this

If everyone followed the golden rule, treating others as they wanted to be treated, I suspect there would be far less pain. There would still be pain, but it would be caused by environment and self, not also others.

Using the principles above, perhaps doing 'good' is simply reducing net pain in the world.

# Means Are the Ends

One has to be careful not to believe, however, that "the ends justify the means", that inflicting pain on others against their will is the best way to reduce overall pain later; for the greater good.

I believe that's the mindset of tyrants. The means ARE a kind of ends.

I want to say 'pain is not inherently bad', but then I'd be using 'bad', which I've defined as increasing pain. So that can't be fully correct.

# 'Effective' and 'Ineffective'

Perhaps more linguistically helpful words would be 'effective' and 'ineffective'. Then we are forced to define, at least a bit more of the 'for what'.

Good for what? Bad for what?

> His behavior is ineffective at promoting others' wellbeing.

> Donuts are ineffective at maintaining ones own wellbeing.

> My actions are ineffective at completing this task.

Doing 'good' must mean doing things that are effective for our and others' wellbeings. People are often really poor judges of what does this, however, but I think treating them as we want to be treated is a relateively effective metric.

# Worship and Wanting to do Good

Worship is an important part of any religion. Scripture study and prayer feels often impossible to me. I often feel no motivation to even read a single verse. Sometimes I'm also afraid of "doing it wrong".

But perhaps I can focus on doing acts of service for others with the idea that I'm serving God, and that can be my method of praise.

And perhaps inspiration may follow that motivates me to read and pray.

To do good. To do God.
