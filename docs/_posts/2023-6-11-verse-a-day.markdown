I'm going to try to study at least one verse of scripture each day. I haven't been able to study consistently, but I have committed to my ecclesiastical leader to this at least.

I use the King James Version of the Bible, and will try to make my own personal translation of verses so I can better understand them. I may venture into other translations, but don't plan on it.

# John 14:1

> Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

-   Let -> Allow or Permit
-   Heart -> Desires or Moral Compass?
-   Troubled -> Interfered with, confused
-   Believe -> Think he exists, Trust, Trust he is who he says he is

One possible interpretation:

> Do not allow your desires to be confused: You trust in God's existence and actions, so also trust and believe in my existence and actions.

## Question: How can desires be confused or interfered with?

Illusions, falsehoods, deceivers. They can cause confusion and lead us to desire in things that lead us to stop believing in God and Jesus.

From a secular point of view, that seems like a great way to get people to stay devoted, possibly even blindly. To some, the Bible is the illusion, the falsehood, the deceiver.

This debate makes me troubled in itself, haha.

I suspect I would be far more troubled by leaving my beliefs than by sticking with them.

My friends who have encouraged me to leave my church for a time imply that certain behaviors like recreational drugs and premarital sex are harmless. I am biased to believe those things ARE harmful.

In my mind, religion aside, I see consequences I do no wish to have.

Inside the church, I am encouraged to strive for self-mastery. To not indulge in self-serving sexual desires. Eventually to use them to create and raise children in love and kindness.

I'm not saying all premarital sex is self-serving, but it seems to be an awful lot. Again, though, my perception is biased.

In addition to continuing to read, perhaps it could benefit me to find and compare social science studies. Can science back up the effectiveness of the behaviors I am taught in my church?

I will admit that I am nervous to do so, as I fear what I believe to be denied.

However, my church also encourages research and learning about these things from reputable sources. Thus, perhaps this kind of research could be a form of worship.

What better way to avoid confusion than by searching for truths?
