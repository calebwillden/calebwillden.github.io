I'm a big fan of [The Keeyp](https://firith.itch.io/the-keeyp), a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) boardgame by [Firith Studio](https://firith.studio/).

I think I mean "fan" as in "fanatic" almost literally, in that I have "excessive zeal" for it. Part of that zeal comes from the game's strengths and part of it comes from a desire to fix it's weaknesses.

Here is a 5-page review exploring the game in-depth, giving it tremendous praise with some big criticisms too:

And here is a document I wrote when I told one of the Firit Studio staff members on their Discord server I had some technical writing revisions for the game, and it turned into a massive multi-section document:

There's some overlap between them, but it amazes me how I can't get myself to write a one-page essay for a graphic design class sometimes, yet I can bust out things like this no problem.

Perhaps web design and development is the wrong field for me?

But here I am.
