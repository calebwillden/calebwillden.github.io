I'm a big fan of [The Keeyp](https://firith.itch.io/the-keeyp), a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) boardgame by [Firith Studio](https://firith.studio/).

I think I mean "fan" as in "fanatic" almost literally, in that I have "excessive zeal" for it. Part of that zeal comes from the game's strengths and part of it comes from a desire to fix it's weaknesses.

# Big Deep-Dive Review

Here is a 5-page review exploring the game in-depth, giving it tremendous praise with some big criticisms too:

# Revisions & Redesigns

And here is a document I wrote when I told one of the Firit Studio staff members on their Discord server I had some technical writing revisions for the game, and it turned into a massive multi-section document:

# What Lights You Up Like a Christmas Tree?

It amazes me how I can't get myself to write a one-page essay for a graphic design class sometimes, yet I can bust out things like this, totally focused in a few hours.

Perhaps web design and development is the wrong field for me. I seem to be much more passionate about board game design.

There's not a whole lot of money in that though...it's a dilema!

One of my aunts says:

`Do what lights you up like a Christmas Tree.`

Technical writing and document formatting seems to do this for me.

_Seeing_ good graphic design does. The _process_ of making good graphic design lights me up like a dead, try Christmas tree set aflame after the new year. But I can technically do it.

Experiencing and creating good user experiences lights me up, I think.

Scouring web development documentation and metaphorically banging my head against the sea of technical knowledge, inconsistencies, and information that I feel I can barely digest and grasp on a good day...yeah, not a fan of that.

But here I am.

# More Board Game Stuff to Come

I've designed a dozen extra characters for the Keeyp, extra tiles, tiles, and game modes. I'll probably post about those later.

Eventually I might post about my board game I've been slowly developing ove the last several years as well, the Super Galactic Postal Service.

# Is Life a Game?

I was trying come up with some sign-off like "Life's not a game, but it's meant to be enjoyed," but then I started thinking, "IS life a game?" That depends on the definition of a game.

I should sleep, though, so we'll leave it there for now:

Is like a game?
