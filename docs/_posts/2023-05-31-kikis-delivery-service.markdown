# Kiki's Delivery Service

In this animated film by Studio Ghibli, a young witch named Kiki leaves home to find a city she can serve and train in. Most witches have specific talents and areas of expertise, but hers is just flying on broomsticks.

She finds a city without a witch, so she decides to settle there. She helps a baker return a baby's pacifier to one of their customers who left without it. With her broom, it's quick work. She soon ends out working for the baker for money and lodging, and even begins a delivery service.

She struggles through a few deliveries, with far more complications than she ever expected. At some point, she helps an old lady bake and deliver a hearty meal for the lady's granddaughter. After so much effort, though, when Kiki delivers the dish, the granddaughter simply remarks how she hates grandma's dishes.

This sends Kiki into depression. She becomes sullen and can't get herself to get up in the morning or do much.

Why is she even there? What's the point?

When her cat starts meowing instead of talking to her, she tries to fly on her broom and can barely keep off the ground for a few seconds.

The baker sends her on foot to deliver something, which she agrees to do. The recipient? A boy who previously showed interest in her and even asked her out. She's flabbergasted, but he convinces her to ride his propeller-powered bike with him. A few collisions and a near-death fall later, she's having the time of her life and laughing hysterically.

Until she sees the ungrateful granddaughter pass by where they crash.

She sullenly walks home, but a painter from the woods she had run into earlier sees her and her state, and invites her to come over to her cabin to stay the night.

A few bus rides and hitchikes later and they reach the cabin, at which point Kiki explains her inability to fly.

The painter mentions that, some days, she just can't paint.

Her solution? Stop trying.

Take naps. Go on walks. Stop trying so hard. "And pretty soon, you'll find yourself flying again."

# Finding Yourself Flying Again

At that point it hit me:

Flying is Kiki's talent. She loves doing it, but finds she can't.

It's not just because there are rules and laws of magic restricting her abilities. It's...just how talents work.

I can sometimes write, or make games, or play music. And sometimes I can't.

Lately, it feels like I can't do these things a LOT of the time, but the idea struck me.

Am I trying too hard? Should I stop?

# Stop Trying Too Hard vs Giving Up

I hate the idea of giving up. I feel I do it a lot, but I always get stuck feeling guilt or shame about things because I'm afraid that I'll stop caring.

My fear is if I stop caring, I'll stop growing. I'll stagnate.

It's a self-fulfilling fear, though, ironically.

At what point am I giving up, versus not trying too hard? Is there a difference?

I've had three separate individuals tell me to give up or take a break from things like my religious beliefs or my attempts to avoid certain addictions. Their reasoning was maybe I need to experience the contrast. If I stop trying and fall into what I'm afraid of, I'll better understand it, and will be more motivated to keep and follow my beliefs.

Opposition. Contrast. Clarity.

There's a logic in it, but I'm afraid to follow it. What if I don't come back to my beliefs? I'm afraid of change, of losing my self and identity.

# Failsafes

One of those individuals told me God would save me from it, and make sure I'd come back to be who I wanted to be.

Do I trust God enough to let go?

Is that the right question to ask?

Do I trust God enough to NOT let go?

Or take God out of the picture and you still end up with the two ideologies.

Both seem like valid strategies and paths through life:

1. Lean into trying things, making mistakes and learning from them.

    or

2. Hold firm to patterns and beliefs. Nourish them. And never let go.

The first seems to be the most growth-conducing method. Yet I believe the second is what's ingrained in my brain.

# The Why

I both want to change, yet don't. The dichotomy of the mind. Desiring variety yet fearing loss of certainty.

Going back to Kiki's Delivery Service, the painter had realized she needed to find her own style and reasons for paining.

Sometimes inspiration would be there. Sometimes it wouldn't be and she'd just have to wait.

So many people talk about discipline, that motivation comes by doing.

That makes literally no sense to me. My understanding is that, in order for the human brain to take an action, it has to be driven by an electrochemical reaction attempting to fulfil a need.

So I just feel broken when people say I should be able to do things without having motivation.

So the question: Is it okay to just rely on inspiration and motivation?

# Good vs. Bad

"Okay" or "Good" or "Bad" are relative.

I hear many people, especially religious ones, talk about the dangers of relativistic moralism. Or whatever it's called.

But the definitions of those words aren't complete on their own. By their linguistic nature, they are relative.

> If an eagle kills a snake, is it a good or a bad thing?

I first heard this question proposed by Andrew Kirby, a "Time Theorist" life-coaching YouTuber.

The snake dies. That's bad for the snake's own perpetuation.

But the eagle has food. That's good for its perpetuation.

If something is "good' or "bad" it must have a purpose tied to it.

# In order to...

Same with "need" and "should".

"I need to file taxes."

"I should get a haircut."

Statements like that are abstractions, shortcuts. The brain relies on shortcuts, but I think these are often unhelpful ones.

"I need to file taxes in order to **\_\_**."

Maintain my livelihood and avoid financial and legal trouble? Keep my civic duty and contribute to society?

It might be an unnecessary expenditure of time and mental effort to fill in the blank every time you make a statement to add an "in order to " turn "good", "bad", "need" or "should".

But it might be helpful!

It can help you identify your why. Are you motivated by hope and devotion, or by fear?

> He who has a WHY to live can bear almost any HOW.

Man's Search for Meaning by Dr. Victor Frankl, holocaust survivor and psychologist who analyzed his own mind during his imprisonment and came to that conclusion.

I'm starting to think motivation IS necessary to start anything, but the kind of motivation can vary.

-   Motivation out of fear of not being good enough?

-   Motivation out of curiosity or to find satisfaction in the art of doing?

-   Motivation out of a desire for consistency and hope for eventual returns on efforts?

Inspiration leads to motivation, is what I'm thinking.

# Finding Inspiration

It seems inspiration can lead to a why, which leads to motivation, which leads to capability.

This probably isn't everyone, but I want capability. This is probably due to my fear of worthlessness; or fear of my need for "significance' not being met (Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs).

People are less depressed are often those who get out, walk, adventure, socialize, try things.

Is this because doing things and experiencing things inspires them?

Ah, this is what people must mean by motivation comes after doing.

I wonder if those with high levels of discipline have trained so much that they believe action will give them motivation. They desire motivation, so the promise of motivation is enough motivation to start action.

> Exercising faith qualifies us for the gift of great faith.

An instructor of the Institute of Religion said this. It seemed a paradox. How can faith be required to get faith?

The only logical answer is, everyone has some degree of faith.

Same must apply to motivation. Everyone must have some degree of motivation about something. Finding and using that can lead to inspiration, which can lead to more motivation.

# How to Find Inspiration

I often _want_ to want to do things.

But if Kiki's Delivery Service is right, inspiration will come.

If I can use what motivation I DO have to put myself in a position to receive more inspiration, then that seems more time-effective than simply waiting.

But theoreticlaly, it could work either way. Neat.

Armed with the knowledge that doing things like going on walks may lead to capability, perhaps that will be enough to get me going.

That was quite the ramble. But that's what this site is for.

God bless.
