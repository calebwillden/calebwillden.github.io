I've been a Christian my whole life, more specifically, I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life.

That's bound to cause many to make assumptions about me, but I'm not here to preach. I'm here to explore the idea behind a Sabbath Day, why it exists, and what psychological benefits it might have.

I'm no psychologist, but I love learning and thinking about religion in the context of science.

# What's a "Sabbath Day"?

In my church, the Sabbath Day is Sunday, called that because it is a day to be set apart from other days. Set apart how? In purpose. In how it is spent.

Keeping the Sabbath Day holy is one of the ten commandments Moses brought down from Mt. Sinai when he was leading the children of Israel in chapter 20 of the book of Exodus in the Old Testament.

Keeping the day holy means to keep the time spent dedicated to God.

I've been taught to dedicate my whole life to God, but the Sabbath is meant for things different than other days, and not just another Saturday. Generally speaking, I've been taught to avoid practicing a profession as well as engaging in entertainment and recreation that doesn't point to God.

Do I do that? Inconsistently.

But I'd like to change that, because I want to see if it benefits me. God has promised peace if we come unto Christ, so I'd like to put that to the test on a more formal level.

# Commandments vs. Good Advice From God

I see no difference between the two.

The God I believe in is not some demanding taskmaster with a list of requirements to enter through the gates of heaven and avoid being tossed into the pits of hell.

In my mind, the commandments of God are given as instructions for how to achieve a more fulfilled and peace-filled life. If not immediately, at least in the long-term.

-   Don't steal? Pretty good way to keep people happy and peaceful.

-   Don't commit adultery? Great way to maintain trust and mutual care between spouses.

-   Don't covet? Gratitude has been scientifically proven to be a powerful emotion that increases overall happiness.

They didn't have neuroscientists back in Moses' time, yet these things seem, to me, to be supported by modern-day science.

Confirmation bias is high possibility for why I believe this, but most people seem to also intuitively understand that stealing and cheating on partners is problematic for maintaining healthy societies and relationships.

So what does this have to do with the Sabbath Day?

# Focus Affects Function

I'm just some guy on the internet with an interest in psychology. Should I find sources to back up my claims? Probably. Will I? Not always, because then I won't write this.

When a neurons fires, its pathways are made stronger, more insulated to create a more steady path of least resistance. Evolution-wise, this reduces wasted energy, which increase human survival-rate. So people with more efficient brain shortcuts that supported survival tended to survive and reproduce.

When you do something or think about something repeatedly, you strengthen the neurons that support that activity and allow you to do it. The more they fire, the less energy it takes them to fire over time. I imagine that means its easier for all connected neurons and related brain patterns to fire off of them.

Focus affects function.

What you think about changes how your brain processes information. It becomes easier for your brain to connect things to the strongest processes in your mind.

The Sabbath Day, including going to church, partaking in the Sacrament / Holy Communion, scriptural study, service and care to others...I believe they are all encouraged to lead to better well-being.

# My Cousin, the Space Force Guy

I have a cousin who is on the U.S. Space Force.

He wasn't doing well in school studying engineering of some kind. He had a family, a full-time job, and was falling behind in school.

At some point, he decided he couldn't do it, so he decided to put the Lord first.

He wouldn't do any coursework on Sundays, and he always made time to pray and listen by studying God's word each day.

Soon, while classmates grades declined, his went up. He was spending less time and effort on classes, yet he was doing better. Things were making sense for him, and he quickly became a top student, and eventually became part of the Space Force.

Some might say it was a psychological effect, such as a placebo, not a miracle. I say it's both.

I believe the God of this universe uses science to his advantage, to help us become the best versions of ourselves.

How does it work? I'm not quite sure. But somehow, focusing on the Lord was able to open his mind and heart into a higher state of function.

# The Three Week Test

Over the next three weeks, I'd like to test this for myself.

I'm going to spend each Sabbath Day exclusively on connecting with the Lord and his children (including my family and friends), and forgo easy, high-dopamine activities like games, browsing the internet, playing video games, etc.

A bit like dopamine detox. A change from the norm. Something to keep more brain cells active and healthy to expand brain function and capacity.

I want to know: will doing so improve my intrinsic motivation and decrease my depression and anxiety?

My hypothesis is yes. I'll post updates each week.

# It's Going to Be Tough

I haven't even started yet and I'm feeling strain. There's a long YouTube video essay about the handheld Legend of Zelda games that I feel compelled to watch...but it would be contrary to my challenge.

I need meaningful activities to engage in (like this digital garden blog thing). Here are my ideas:

-   Text friends to see how they're doing.

-   Compose an fast-paced, syncopated version of the hymn "There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today" on MuseScore.

-   Watch Bible Project videos and listen to podcasts.

-   Read the New Testament.

-   Find and read a Gospel-related book. Put on my glasses I don't use and see if it helps with my dislike of reading.

-   Wrap a month-late birthday present I got for my sister.

-   Write an email to a friend currently in Liberia.

-   Call my older brother just to chat.

-   Update my mom's digital picture frame with another batch of family pictures.

-   Practice a simple hymn on piano (I'm not very experienced but every year I find myself trying to get back into piano)

-   Go on a walk to enjoy the grass, trees, and view of Utah Lake.

-   Help index records on [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org).

Seems like a decent list.

Whether you're religious or not, consider finding a day or specific time to set aside for something different. We'll see how it goes!

God bless.
