# I Did It!

I did fancy tech-typing and documentation-reading to make a static website that's hosted on the internet.

_(I even figured out how to add an image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)!)_

Technically, I've done it before as part of web design and development classes, but none of those...did anything.

# Digital Garden

I suppose this doesn't do much of anything either. But now I understand that's the point.

This is my digital garden, inspired by the brilliant Brad Woods' Digital Garden at https://garden.bradwoods.io:

`A digital garden is an approach to publishing personal knowledge on the web. Different than a blog that contains polished articles in reverse chronological order. Digital gardens are more like work-in-progress wikis. A collection of unrefined, incomplete ideas that grow & evolve over time through constant tending (editing, rewriting & revising).`

Except I hate yardwork.

My kind of garden might end out more like constantly letting things spew out, fall into the background and exist while I move onto other things.

So rather than tend pages I create, I think I might just keep planting new things here.

But who knows! I may find a fondness for certain pages and turn them into a hub of my knowledge and ramblings about certain topics.

## Qualities of a Digital Garden

Also taken from Brad Woods' about page:

-   Organized by contextual relationships
-   Learning in public
-   Imperfection
-   Playful, personal & experimental
-   Diverse content mediums (videos, podcasts, short notes, long essays, sketches, ...)
-   Independent ownership

I'm not sure how well I'll stick to these qualities either, but I'm okay with that.

This is my garden.

I'm not going to write for an audience. I'm going to write for me.

# 26 Years in the Making

This site technically only took me a couple of hours, but it felt like years.

I've been working on my four-year degree in Web Design & Development for around 7 years. I'm a senior, yet feel like I know nothing. This site has proven that objectively false.

I'm slower than others seem to be. I'm learning to be okay with that.

I'm an extrovert with social anxiety, and Major Depressive Disorder. I'm living at home with my parents.

I'm incredibly grateful for their care. It's hard not to feel like a drain on people. I don't _want_ feel like I'm doing nothing with my life, but it often feels impossible to get my body to do simple things.

I know I'm not the only one.

I have to be patient with myself.

I've just realized how many times I've started a paragraph with "I".

But that's okay. Watch, I'll do it again:

# I'm a Perfectionist in Denial

The irony of that is I've admited it finally, so does that mean I'm no longer in de denial?

It's extremely difficult for my brain to initiate progress on a task without feeling like it has a near-complete understanding of the goal, purpose, risks, and variables. As an artist of many kinds, this makes life difficult.

But here I am. I don't plan to do much post-editing with these posts. Because I don't have to. I'm doing this for me.

# Expanding My Scope

I'd like to expand my scope of capabilities by discussing them. Processing things should, theoretically, make it easier for my brain to do them. It has explored possibilities by transcribing thoughts into words.

Topics I hope to venture into include:

-   **Good Design vs. Bad Design:** I love exploring design of all kinds, like devices, cars, sites, apps, doorknobs, buildings, posters, logos, games, and more.

-   **Technical Writing:** An often highly undervalued and underdeveloped skill for something that most humans do every day.

-   **Interpersonal Philosophies:** I believe all humans are doing their best. This affects how I choose to treat others and view others in a way that makes most people apparently like me.

-   **Science, Religion, and Existentialism:** I've never formally studied philosphy, but I have a great many thoughts about the nature of our existence and how the universe functions.
-   **Tabletop Roleplaying Games:** I play and design third party content rules expansions for Dungeons & Dragons ([Unraveled Archives](https://unraveledarchives.com/)), and I delve into other games as well.

I think that's enough for now. I'm liking the idea behind this. There's no pressure. Just a space for me to spew out stuff I think about.

If you're reading this, I hope we both continue to learn that we're doing our best, and how to grow that best steadily and surely.

God bless us, every one.

Not sure what this is here, but it was built-in code from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the framework used to create this site, and I want to see what it does.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
